# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `services/extractor`: Python ingestion and normalization service; tests live in `services/extractor/tests`.
- `web/console`: React/TypeScript console app; component specs sit in `web/console/src/**/__tests__`.
- `docs`: Sphinx sources plus ADR catalog; update `docs/SCHEMAS.md` when editing `src/**/schemas/*.yaml`.
- `reports`: Local staging for `reports/junit.xml` and `reports/coverage.xml`; keep artifacts out of Git.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `make setup`: Install Python tooling, JS dependencies, and pre-commit hooks.
- `make build`: Compile extractor wheels and bundle the console.
- `npm --prefix web/console run dev`: Launch the console dev server with hot reload.
- `docker compose up --build -d`: Bring up extractor + console stack for integrated smoke checks.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Standardize on LF endings, two-space indentation, and kebab-case filenames across packages.
- Python: format via `black .` (24.8) and lint with `ruff check .`; pre-commit runs both plus `black --check .`.
- TypeScript: run `npm run fmt` (Prettier) and `npm run lint` (ESLint; config in `web/console/.eslintrc.cjs`); console overrides live in `web/console/AGENTS.md`.
- Secrets stay in `.env` for local use, but prefer the secret manager for shared credentials.

## Testing Guidelines
- Python: `pytest -q` for unit suites; keep `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing` >= 80% coverage.
- TypeScript: `npm --prefix web/console test -- --ci` with console coverage >= 85%; rerun flaky suites once when marked `flaky` or `network`.
- Clear caches (`.pytest_cache`, `node_modules/.cache`) if runs diverge before re-invoking tests.
- Publish CI artifacts to `reports/` on pipelines; avoid committing generated files locally.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat(extract): add table detector`, `fix(validate): handle zero tax invoices`).
- Populate the PR template: summary, validation, rollout risks, and linked issues/ADRs; attach UI screenshots when console views change.
- Autogenerated reviewers map to touched paths, so double-check assignments before requesting review.
- Merge only after `lint`, `unit`, `coverage>=0.80`, and `docs-updated` checks succeed; run `make docs` when API or schema contracts change.

## Documentation & Architecture Notes
- Regenerate docs with `make docs` after altering public APIs or schema files; Typedoc output ships alongside Sphinx.
- Capture design-impacting decisions under `docs/adr/` using the template; note rationale and follow-up tasks.
